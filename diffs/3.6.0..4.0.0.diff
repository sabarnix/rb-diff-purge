 # Changelog
 
+## RBP v4: "The One With Hooks (And Much More)" Edition (April 2019)
+
+### News
+
+React Boilerplate v4.0.0 is out and it's a doozy! Here are the highlights:
+
+- React has added many new features and it's time for React Boilerplate to embrace them.
+  - We now use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for component lazy-loading instead of an external library.
+  - We've added `useInjectSaga` and `useInjectReducer` hooks to manage saga and reducer injection. They're integrated into the generators and thus become the new defaults. (Should you need them, the HOCs are still there.)
+  - The generators don't support classes anymore. The `PureComponent` vs `Component` choice was replaced with an option to wrap your component inside `React.memo`.
+- After much deliberation, `Immutable.js` is finally gone. We've added `Immer` instead. With it, we can write very concise and readable reducers while sticking to native JavaScript data structures.
+- Following the release of React Hooks, it's become even clearer that `react-testing-library` is now the industry-standard for React DOM testing. Workarounds for the incompatibilities between `enzyme` and `styled-components` are gone and we can now write leaner and more meaningful tests.
+
+There are many more changes to our documentation, internals and general project setup. You can find a full changelog below.
+
+Huge thanks to @Mensae, @gretzky, @jwinn and everyone who helped review or submit PRs! If I've forgotten your contribution in the credits below, please let me know.
+
+We hope you enjoy this release and welcome any feedback, bug reports or feature suggestions you can send our way!

+## 3.7 October 2018
+
+### News
+
+Welcome to a new React Boilerplate release with improvements aplenty, bug fixes and major dependency upgrades! Big thanks to @gretzky, @justingreenberg, @jwinn and everyone who helped review and submit PRs for this release!
+
+For existing projects, the only way to upgrade from `3.6.0` is to manually apply the changes from #2403 to your project. Please be careful when doing so as it isn't officially supported and could break things on your end.
+
+Next steps will include re-thinking immutability in the store (RFC @ #2092), re-organizing docs, saga improvements, smart bundling and plenty more. Please keep the PRs coming. And if you're up for it, remember that you can use the dev branch to test all the latest updates and report bugs!
+
+### Main
+
+- **Upgrades to Babel 7, React 16.6, ESLint 5, styled-components 4** (@julienben)
+  - Config file and Babel plugin cleanup (@gretzky)
+  - Fix extract-intl script for Babel 7 (@fanixk)
+- **Webpack improvements**
+  - Removal of dll plugin (@gretzky)
+  - Gzipping and better optimization config in prod (@gretzky)
+  - react-app-polyfill for targeted IE support (@gretzky)
+  - Switch from UglifyJS to Terser plugin (@robertaird)
+  - Icons generated by webpack-pwa-manifest plugin (@Mensae)
+- **Switch from Yarn back to npm** (@julienben)
+  - CI improvements (@jwinn)
+- **New documentation section for forks**
+  - SSR (@gretzky)
+  - Electron (@mjangir)
+  - TypeScript (@Can-Sahin)
+
+### Other Updates
+
+- Migration from deprecated react-router-redux to connected-react-router (@julienben)
+- Migration from react-loadable to loadable-components (@julienben)
+- Quick start - Clone to a named directory (@spawnia)
+- Scoped variables in i18n messages (@hatsuo)

+### News
 
 Major version updates are finally here! It's been awhile, but we're a small team that's been pushing this for awhile. Thanks to several users' PRs, we were able to cherry-pick a lot from the dev branch to push this release out. We decided because of the amount of dependencies that needed to be updated- we would overshoot some of the changes made on the dev branch and just grab the most pressing ones.

+# Forks
+
+## Electron
+
+Electron is a very popular open source library developed by GitHub. It enables the creation of cross-platform desktop applications using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This fork provide steps through which you can kickstart an Electron application using `react-boilerplate`.
+
+Electron provides a combined single runtime of Chromium and Node.js. No server is needed to host your React application. You can simply package the entire source code in a `.exe`, `.dmg` or `.deb` file.
+
+This fork gives you two options:
+
+1. Clone the repository for a fresh start: [reactron](https://github.com/mjangir/reactron)
+
+2. Read the steps to [convert an existing RBP-based project to an Electron application](https://github.com/mjangir/reactron/wiki/Convert-Existing-To-Electron)
+
+## Server-side rendering
+
+This repo receives many requests for server-side rendering and there have been plenty of long discussions on the topic. None have led to an implementation that we're happy to merge into the main repo. That being said, @gretzky has a fork which you can use as a solid starting point for your SSR needs: [react-boilerplate-ssr](https://github.com/gretzky/react-boilerplate-ssr)
+
+## TypeScript
+
+Since we don't support TypeScript out of the box, for those in need, we can direct you to a TypeScript implementation of this repo.

-_Step 3:_ Add this line to your `package.json` file in the scripts area: `"heroku-postbuild": "npm run build",`. This is so Heroku can build your production assets when deploying (more of which you can [read about here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support#heroku-specific-build-steps)). Then, adjust the _prebuild_ script in your `package.json` file so it looks like this: `"prebuild": "npm run build:clean",` to avoid having Heroku attempt to run Jest tests (which are unsupported with this buildpack).

+## AWS Elastic Beanstalk
+
+Please refer to to issue [#2566](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/issues/2566) for more explanation.
+
+### Pre-requisites
+
+1. Create an account on [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
+2. Install EB CLI ([AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html?icmpid=docs_elasticbeanstalk_console#eb-cli3-install.cli-only))
+3. Create your [AWS EB profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-configuration.html#eb-cli3-profile).
+   In case you are using a continous deployment tool, you can create another user
+   for your CD tool as well.
+4. Create your Elastic Beanstalk [application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/applications.html) and [environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.managing.html) (either via CLI or web console)
+5. [Configure your EB CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-configuration.html). You should have a `.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml` if properly configured
+
+### Configuration
+
+_Step 1:_ Add AWS EB start scripts in _package.json_: `"aws-eb:prod": "npm run build && npm run start:prod"`
+
+_Step 2:_ Create a `.ebextensions/aws.config` file:
+
+```yaml
+# Check https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/issues/2566 for details
+option_settings:
+  aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:nodejs:
+    NodeCommand: 'npm run aws-eb:prod'
+  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
+    NPM_USE_PRODUCTION: false
+```
+
+In the likely case of multiple environment, remove the `NodeCommand` entry and
+manually configure it per environment in the web console: _Configuration > Software > Node command_.
+
+_Step 3:_ Create a `.npmrc` file:
+
+```
+# Check https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/issues/2566 for details
+unsafe-perm=true
+```
+
+_Step 4:_ commit your changes and deploy via EB CLI:
+
+```sh
+eb deploy {target environment name}
+```

+
+Immutable data structures can be deeply compared in no time. This allows us to
+efficiently determine if our components need to rerender since we know if the
+`props` changed or not!
+
+Check out [Introducing Immer: Immutability the easy way](https://hackernoon.com/introducing-immer-immutability-the-easy-way-9d73d8f71cb3)
+and/or [The Rise of Immer in React](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/09/12/the-rise-of-immer-in-react/)
+for a good explanation of how Immer works and the more intricate benefits it provides.
+
+## Usage
+
+The basic idea behind Immer is that you will apply all your changes to a temporary
+draftState, which is a proxy of the currentState. Once all your mutations are completed,
+Immer will produce the nextState based on the mutations to the draft state. (See the
+[official docs](https://github.com/mweststrate/immer) for more details.)
+
+The Immer package exposes the `produce` function which we use in the following way inside our reducers:
+
+```JS
+import produce from 'immer';
+import { SOME_ACTION, SOME_OTHER_ACTION } from './actions';
+
+// […]
+
+/* eslint-disable default-case, no-param-reassign */
+const myReducer = (state = initialState, action) =>
+  produce(state, draft => {
+    switch (action.type) {
+      case SOME_ACTION:
+        draft.myData = action.payload;
+        break;
+      case SOME_OTHER_ACTION:
+        draft.myData.message = action.payload;
+        break;
+    }
+  });
+```
+
+We use [`reselect`](./reselect.md) to efficiently cache our computed application
+state.
+
+```JS
+const myDataSelector = (state) => state.myData;
+const messageSelector = (state) => state.myData.message;
+
+export default myDataSelector;

-# ImmutableJS
-
-Immutable data structures can be deeply compared in no time. This allows us to
-efficiently determine if our components need to rerender since we know if the
-`props` changed or not!
-
-Check out the [official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)
-for a good explanation of the more intricate benefits it has.
-
-## Usage
-
-In our reducers, we make the initial state an immutable data structure with the
-`fromJS` function. We pass it an object or an array, and it takes care of
-converting it to a immutable data structure. (Note: the conversion is performed deeply so
-that even arbitrarily nested arrays/objects are immutable structures too!)
-
-```JS
-import { fromJS } from 'immutable';
-
-const initialState = fromJS({
-  myData: {
-  	message: 'Hello World!'
-  },
-});
-```
-
-When a reducer is subscribed to an action and needs to return the new state they can do so by using setter methods such as [`.set`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/Map/set) and [`.update`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/Map/update) and [`.merge`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/Map/merge).  
-If the changing state data is nested, we can utilize the 'deep' versions of these setters: [`.setIn`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/Map/setIn) and [`.updateIn`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/Map/updateIn), [`.mergeIn`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/Map/mergeIn).
-
-```JS
-import { SOME_ACTION, SOME_OTHER_ACTION } from './actions';
-
-// […]
-
-function myReducer(state = initialState, action) {
-  switch (action.type) {
-    case SOME_ACTION:
-      return state.set('myData', action.payload);
-    case SOME_OTHER_ACTION:
-      return state.setIn(['myData', 'message'], action.payload);
-    default:
-      return state;
-  }
-}
-```
-
-We use [`reselect`](./reselect.md) to efficiently cache our computed application
-state. Since that state is now immutable, we need to use the [`.get`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/Iterable/get) and [`.getIn`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/Iterable/getIn)
-functions to select the part we want.
-
-```JS
-const myDataSelector = (state) => state.get('myData');
-const messageSelector = (state) => state.getIn(['myData', 'message']);
-
-export default myDataSelector;
-```

-
-## Immutable Records
-
-ImmutableJS provides a number of immutable structures such as [`Map`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/Map), [`Set`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/Set) and [`List`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/List).
-One drawback to these structures is that properties must be accessed via the getter methods (`.get` or `.getIn`) and cannot be accessed with dot notation as they would in a plain javascript object.  
-For instance you'll write `map.get('property')` instead of `object.property`, and `list.get(0)` instead of `array[0]`.  
-This can make your code a little harder to follow and requires you to be extra cautious when passing arguments or props to functions or components that try to access values with regular dot notation.  
-ImmutableJS's [`Record`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/Record) structure offers a solution to this issue.
-
-A `Record` is similar to a `Map` but has a fixed shape, meaning it's property keys are predefined and you can't later add a new property after the record is created. Attempting to set new properties will cause an error.  
-One benefit of `Record` is that you can now, along with other immutable read methods (.get, .set, .merge and so on), use the dot notation to access properties.
-
-The creation of a record is less simple than simply calling `.toJS()`.  
-First, you have to define the `Record` shape. With the example above, to create your initial state, you'll write:
-
-```JS
-// Defining the shape
-const StateRecord = Record({
-  myData: {
-      message: 'Hello World!'
-  }
-});
-
-const initialState = new StateRecord({}); // initialState is now a new StateRecord instance
-                                          // initialized with myData.message set by default as 'Hello World!'
-```
-
-Now, if you want to access `myData`, you can just write `state.myData` in your reducer code and to access the `message` property you can write `state.myData.message` as you would in a plain javascript object.
-
-### Gotchas of Using Records
-
-Although dot notation can now be used to read properties the same does not apply to setting properties. Any attempts to set a property on a `Record` using dot notation will result in errors.
-Instead setter methods ( `.set`, `.update`, `.merge`) should be used.
-
-Certain properties can not be set on a record as they would conflict with the API. Consider the below example:
-
-```JS
-const ProductRecord = Record({
-    type: 'tshirt',
-    size: 'small'
-});
-```
-
-Because record.size is used to return the records count (similar to array.length), the above definition would throw an error.

+In order to write more maintainable tests which also resemble more closely the way

+This library renders our component within an actual DOM and provides utilities for querying it.
 
-Lets test our `<Button>` component! We're going to assess three things: First,
-that it renders a HTML `<button>` tag, second that it renders its children we
-pass it and third that handles clicks!
+Let's give it a go with our `<Button />` component, shall we? First, let's check that it renders our component with its
+children, if any, and second that it handles clicks.
 
-This is our Jest setup:
+This is our test setup:
 
 ```javascript
 import React from 'react';
-import { shallow } from 'enzyme';
-import Button from '../Button.react';
+import { render, fireEvent } from 'react-testing-library';
+import Button from '../Button';
 
 describe('<Button />', () => {
-  it('renders a <button>', () => {});
-
-  it('renders its children', () => {});
+  it('renders and matches the snapshot', () => {});
 
   it('handles clicks', () => {});
 });
 ```
 
-Lets start with testing that it renders a `<button>`. To do that we first
-`shallow` render it, and then `expect` that a `<button>` node exists.
+### Snapshot testing
 
-```javascript
-it('renders a <button>', () => {
-  const renderedComponent = shallow(<Button />);
-  expect(renderedComponent.find('button').node).toBeDefined();
-});
-```
+Let's start by ensuring that it renders our component and no changes happened to it since the last time it was
+successfully tested.
 
-Nice! If somebody breaks our button component by having it render an `<a>` tag
-or something else we'll immediately know! Let's do something a bit more advanced
-now, and check that our `<Button>` renders its children.
+We will do so by rendering it and creating a _[snapshot](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing)_
+which can be compared with a previously committed snapshot. If no snapshot exists, a new one is created.
 
-We render our button component with some text, and then verify that our text
-exists:
+For this, we first call `render`. This will render our `<Button />` component into a _container_, by default a 
+`<div>`, which is appended to `document.body`. We then create a snapshot and `expect` that this snapshot is the same as
+the existing snapshot, taken in a previous run of this test and committed to the repository.
 
 ```javascript
-it('renders its children', () => {
+it('renders and matches the snapshot', () => {
   const text = 'Click me!';
-  const renderedComponent = shallow(<Button>{text}</Button>);
-  expect(renderedComponent.contains(text)).toEqual(true);
+  const { container } = render(<Button>{text}</Button>);
+
+  expect(container.firstChild).toMatchSnapshot();
 });
 ```
 
-Great! Onwards to our last and most advanced test: checking that our `<Button>` handles clicks correctly. We'll use a Spy for that. A Spy is a
-function that knows if, and how often, it has been called. We create the Spy
-(thoughtfully provided by `expect`), pass _it_ as the `onClick` handler to our
-component, simulate a click on the rendered `<button>` element and, lastly,
-see that our Spy was called:
+`render` returns an object that has a property `container` and yes, this is the container our
+`<Button />` component has been rendered in.
+
+As this is rendered within a _normal_ DOM we can query our
+component with `container.firstChild`. This will be our subject for a snapshot.
+Snapshots are placed in the `__snapshots__` folder within our `tests` folder. Make sure you commit
+these snapshots to your repository.
+
+Great! So, now if anyone makes any change to our `<Button />` component the test will fail and we get notified of what
+changed.
+
+### Behavior testing
+
+Onwards to our last and most advanced test: checking that our `<Button />` handles clicks correctly.
+
+We'll use a [mock function](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions) for this. A mock function is a function that
+keeps track of _if_, _how often_, and _with what arguments_ it has been called. We pass this function as the `onClick` handler to our component, 
+simulate a click and, lastly, check that our mock function was called:
 
 ```javascript
 it('handles clicks', () => {
-  const onClickSpy = jest.fn();
-  const renderedComponent = shallow(<Button onClick={onClickSpy} />);
-  renderedComponent.find('button').simulate('click');
-  expect(onClickSpy).toHaveBeenCalled();
+  const onClickMock = jest.fn();
+  const text = 'Click me!';
+  const { getByText } = render(<Button onClick={onClickMock}>{text}</Button>);
+
+  fireEvent.click(getByText(text));
+  expect(onClickSpy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
 });
 ```
-
 Our finished test file looks like this:
 
 ```javascript
 import React from 'react';
-import { shallow } from 'enzyme';
-import Button from '../Button.react';
+import { render, fireEvent } from 'react-testing-library';
+import Button from '../Button';
 
 describe('<Button />', () => {
-  it('renders a <button>', () => {
-    const renderedComponent = shallow(<Button />);
-    expect(renderedComponent.find('button').node).toBeDefined();
-  });
-
-  it('renders its children', () => {
+  it('renders and matches the snapshot', () => {
     const text = 'Click me!';
-    const renderedComponent = shallow(<Button>{text}</Button>);
-    expect(renderedComponent.contains(text)).toEqual(true);
+    const { container } = render(<Button>{text}</Button>);
+
+    expect(container.firstChild).toMatchSnapshot();
   });
 
   it('handles clicks', () => {
-    const onClickSpy = jest.fn();
-    const renderedComponent = shallow(<Button onClick={onClickSpy} />);
-    renderedComponent.find('button').simulate('click');
-    expect(onClickSpy).toHaveBeenCalled();
+    const onClickMock = jest.fn();
+    const text = 'Click me!';
+    const { getByText } = render(<Button onClick={onClickMock}>{text}</Button>);
+  
+    fireEvent.click(getByText(text));
+    expect(onClickSpy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
   });
 });
