+# Contributing to react-boilerplate
+
+Love react-boilerplate and want to help? Thanks so much, there's something to do for everybody!
+
+Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.
+
+Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.
+
+## Using the issue tracker
+
+The [issue tracker](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/issues) is
+the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs), [features requests](#features)
+and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests).
+
+<a name="bugs"></a>
+## Bug reports
+
+A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
+Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!
+
+Guidelines for bug reports:
+
+1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.
+
+2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `master` or development branch in the repository.
+
+3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a [reduced test case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.
+
+A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
+experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.
+
+Example:
+
+> Short and descriptive example bug report title
+>
+> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
+> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
+>
+> 1. This is the first step
+> 2. This is the second step
+> 3. Further steps, etc.
+>
+> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
+>
+> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
+> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
+> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
+> merits).
+
+
+<a name="features"></a>
+## Feature requests
+
+Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.
+
+
+<a name="pull-requests"></a>
+## Pull requests
+
+Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
+help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
+commits.
+
+**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
+implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
+otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
+project's developers might not want to merge into the project.
+
+Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation,
+accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).
+
+Since the `master` branch is what people actually use in production, we have a
+`dev` branch that unstable changes get merged into first. Only when we
+consider that stable we merge it into the `master` branch and release the
+changes for real.
+
+Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work
+included in the project:
+
+1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:
+
+   ```bash
+   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
+   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/react-boilerplate.git
+   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
+   cd react-boilerplate
+   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
+   git remote add upstream https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate.git
+   ```
+
+2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:
+
+   ```bash
+   git checkout dev
+   git pull upstream dev
+   ```
+
+3. Create a new topic branch (off the `dev` branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:
+
+   ```bash
+   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
+   ```
+
+4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/) feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.
+
+5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream dev branch into your topic branch:
+
+   ```bash
+   git pull [--rebase] upstream dev
+   ```
+
+6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:
+
+   ```bash
+   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
+   ```
+
+7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
+    with a clear title and description.
+
+**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project
+owners to license your work under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

-# CSS Modules
-
-With CSS Modules, all class names are locally scoped by default. This means
-no more bugs from classname clashes. Being to compose primitives to build
-up behaviour also lets us bring programming best practice to CSS: DRY, reusable,
-modular code FTW!
-
-For a detailed explanation see the
-[official documentation](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).
-
-## Usage
-
-Write your CSS normally in the `styles.css` file in the component folder.
-
-```css
-/* styles.css */
-
-.saveBtn {
-  composes: btn from '../components/btn'; // Yay for composition!
-
-  background-color: green;
-  color:            white;
-}
-```
-
-Then `import` the CSS file in your component JavaScript file, and reference the
-class name in the `className` prop.
-
-```javascript
-// index.js
-
-import styles from './styles.css';
-
-// ...inside the render()...
-
-return (
-  <button className={ styles.saveBtn }>
-    Save!
-  </button>
-);
-```

-# PostCSS
-
-PostCSS is a modular CSS preprocessor based on JavaScript. It comes pre-
-configured with the plugins listed below.
-
-See the [official documentation](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) for more
-information!
-
-## Plugins
-
-This boilerplate bundles a few of the most useful PostCSS plugins by default:
-
-- [`postcss-focus`](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-focus): Adds a `:focus`
-  selector to every `:hover` selector for keyboard accessibility.

+# `styled-components`
+
+`styled-components` allow you to write actual CSS code in your JavaScript to style your components,
+removing the mapping between components and styles.
+
+See the
+[official documentation](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
+for more information!
+
+## Usage
+
+This creates two react components, `<Title>` and `<Wrapper>`:
+
+```JSX
+import React from 'react';
+
+import styled from 'styled-components';
+
+// Create a <Title> react component that renders an <h1> which is
+// centered, palevioletred and sized at 1.5em
+const Title = styled.h1`
+  font-size: 1.5em;
+  text-align: center;
+  color: palevioletred;
+`;
+
+// Create a <Wrapper> react component that renders a <section> with
+// some padding and a papayawhip background
+const Wrapper = styled.section`
+  padding: 4em;
+  background: papayawhip;
+`;
+```
+
+*(The CSS rules are automatically vendor prefixed, so you don't have to think about it!)*
+
+You render them like so:
+
+```JSX
+// Use them like any other React component – except they're styled!
+<Wrapper>
+  <Title>Hello World, this is my first styled component!</Title>
+</Wrapper>
+```
+
+For further examples see the
+[official documentation](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).

+# Extracting components
+
+One of the most compelling arguments for the self-contained components
+architecture is the ability to easily reuse each component in other projects.
+Since all the files kept in the same folder, this should be a breeze.
+
+## When?
+
+Often when working on a project, you find you've created a component that you
+could use is other upcoming projects. You would like to extract that
+component to its own git repository and npm package since keeping the version
+histories separate makes a lot of sense.
+
+You're not finished with the component, but would like to continue working on it
+in parallel alongside your main project.
+
+## How?
+
+Since all the files are kept in the same place, its simply a matter of moving
+the folder to its own directory, setting up the `package.json` for your new
+package, and including it in your main project.
+
+### Npm
+
+Npm has a great feature that allows this kind of parallel development of
+packages - `npm link` (read more [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link)). After
+setting up your new package, you can link it into your main package like this:
+
+ 1. `cd` into your new package directory
+ 2. Run `npm link`
+ 3. `cd` into your main project directory
+ 4. Run `npm link <new-package>`
+
+### Configuration
+
+#### Specifying dependencies
+
+Linking the packages won't save the package as a dependency in your main project
+`package.json`, so you'll have to do that manually.
+
+```json
+"dependencies": {
+  "<new-package>": "*",
+}
+```
+
+#### Excluding from Dll
+
+This boilerplate uses the webpack DllPlugin which optimizes build times during
+development. This assumes that your dependencies rarely change and precompiles
+them into one big bundle. But since you will be changing your new package quite
+often, this is probably not what you want.
+
+You can specify that you don't want this package to be included in the dll by
+adding the following to your `package.json`.
+
+```json
+"dllPlugin": {
+  "exclude": [
+    "<new-package>",
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+That's it, you should be all set to work on both your packages. Webpack will
+monitor both your new package and your main project for changes and rebuild
+whenever you change something. This makes development a lot simpler when trying
+to keep things separate while still working on them at the same time.
+
+## Gotchas
+
+As well as this approach works for development, there are some things you need
+to watch out for when building and publishing your new package or project.
+
+### Publishing to npm registry
+
+In your new package, you will most likely have a build task to transpile from
+ES6 into ES5. You probably keep your ES6 code in a `src/` directory and your
+transpiled code in a `lib/` directory.
+
+In your `package.json`, you probably have something like this:
+
+```json
+  "main": "lib/index.js"
+```
+
+This is what you want when you publish to the registry, but during development
+you probably want to change this to
+
+```json
+  "main": "src/index.js"
+```
+
+This will make sure that your main project always includes your most recent
+code. You've just got to remember to change it back to `lib/` before publishing
+to the npm registry.
+
+You can, of course, go down the `lib/` path, but that requires you to
+rebuild your package and transpile it to ES5 whenever you introduce a change,
+which can be a pain.
+
+### Building
+
+Building the package can be a little bit tricky due to how webpack handles
+symlinks. We've found it easiest to remove the symlink and replace it with the
+actual files, either by copying the package to `node_modules` or running
+`npm install` if you've published your package to the npm registry.

+# Deployment
+
+## Heroku
+
+### Easy 5-Step Deployment Process
+
+*Step 1:* Create a _Procfile_ with the following line: `web: npm run start:prod`. We do this because Heroku runs `npm run start` by default, so we need this setting to override the default run command.
+
+*Step 2:* Install the Node.js buildpack for your Heroku app by running the following command: `heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs#v91 -a [your app name]`. Make sure to replace `#v91` with whatever the latest buildpack is, which you can [find here](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs/releases).
+
+*Step 3:* Add this line to your `package.json` file in the scripts area: `"heroku-postbuild": "npm run build",`. This is so Heroku can build your production assets when deploying (more of which you can [read about here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support#heroku-specific-build-steps)). Then, adjust the _prebuild_ script in your `package.json` file so it looks like this: `"prebuild": "npm run build:clean",` to avoid having Heroku attempt to run Jest tests (which are unsupported with this buildpack).
+
+*Step 4:* Run `heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false` so that Heroku can compile the NPM modules included in your _devDependencies_ (since many of these packages are required for the build process).
+
+*Step 5:* Follow the standard Heroku deploy process:
+
+1. `git add .`
+2. `git commit -m 'Made some epic changes as per usual'`
+3. `git push heroku master`
+
+## AWS S3
+
+### Easy 7-Step Deployment Process
+
+*Step 1:* Run `yarn` to install dependencies, then `npm run build` to create the `./build` folder.
+
+*Step 2:* Navigate to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) and login (or sign up if you don't have an account). Click on `Services` followed by `S3` in the dropdown.
+
+*Step 3:* Click on `Create Bucket` and fill out both your `Bucket Name` and `Region` (for the USA we recommend `US Standard`). Click `Create` to create your bucket.
+
+*Step 4:* Open the `Permissions` accordion on the right (under the `Properties` tab) after selecting your new bucket. Click `Add more permissions`, set the `Grantee` to `Everyone` (or whoever you want to be able to access the website), and give them `View Permissions`. Click `Save`.
+
+*Step 5:* Click on the `Static Website Hosting` accordion where you should see the URL (or *endpoint*) of your website (ie. example.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com). Click `Enable website hosting` and fill in both the `Index document` and `Error document` input fields with `index.html`. Click `Save`.
+
+*Step 6:* Click on your new S3 bucket on the left to open the bucket. Click `Upload` and select all the files within your `./build` folder. Click `Start Upload`. Once the files are done, select all of the files, right-click on the selected files (or click on the `Actions` button) and select `Make Public`.
+
+*Step 7:* Click on the `Properties` tab, open `Static Website Hosting`, and click on the *Endpoint* link. The app should be running on that URL.

+
+## Local webfonts not working for development
+
+In development mode CSS sourcemaps require that styling is loaded by blob://,
+resulting in browsers resolving font files relative to the main document.
+
+A way to use local webfonts in development mode is to add an absolute
+output.publicPath in webpack.dev.babel.js, with protocol.
+
+```javascript
+// webpack.dev.babel.js
+
+output: {
+  publicPath: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/',
+  /* … */
+},
+```
+
+## Non-route containers
+
+> Note: Container will always be nested somewhere below a route. Even if there's dozens of components
+in between, somewhere up the tree will be route. (maybe only "/", but still a route)
+
+### Where do I put the reducer?
+
+While you can include the reducer statically in `reducers.js`, we don't recommend this as you lose
+the benefits of code splitting. Instead, add it as a _composed reducer_. This means that you
+pass actions onward to a second reducer from a lower-level route reducer like so:
+
+
+```JS
+// Main route reducer
+
+function myReducerOfRoute(state, action) {
+  switch (action.type) {
+    case SOME_OTHER_ACTION:
+      return someOtherReducer(state, action);
+  }
+}
+```
+
+That way, you still get the code splitting at route level, but avoid having a static `combineReducers`
+call that includes all of them by default.
+
+*See [this and the following lesson](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-reducer-composition-with-arrays?course=getting-started-with-redux) of the egghead.io Redux course for more information about reducer composition!*
+
+### How do I run the saga?
+
+Since a container will always be within a route, one we can simply add it to the exported array in
+`sagas.js` of the route container somewhere up the tree:
+
+```JS
+// /containers/SomeContainer/sagas.js
+
+import { someOtherSagaFromNestedContainer } from './containers/SomeNestedContainer/sagas';
+
+function* someSaga() { /* … */ }
+
+export default [
+  someSaga,
+  someOtherSagaFromNestedContainer,
+];
+```
+
+Or, if you have multiple sagas in the nested container:
+
+
+```JS
+// /containers/SomeContainer/sagas.js
+
+import nestedContainerSagas from './containers/SomeNestedContainer/sagas';
+
+function* someSaga() { /* … */ }
+
+export default [
+  someSaga,
+  ...nestedContainerSagas,
+];
+```
+
+## Using this boilerplate with WebStorm
+
+WebStorm is a powerful IDE, and why not also use it as debugger tool? Here is the steps
+
+1.  [Install JetBrain Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jetbrains-ide-support/hmhgeddbohgjknpmjagkdomcpobmllji)
+2.  [Setting up the PORT](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/2016.1/using-jetbrains-chrome-extension.html)
+3.  Change WebPack devtool config to `source-map` [(This line)](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/blob/56eb5a0ec4aa691169ef427f3a0122fde5a5aa24/internals/webpack/webpack.dev.babel.js#L65)
+4.  Run web server (`npm run start`)
+5.  Create Run Configuration (Run > Edit Configurations)
+6.  Add new `JavaScript Debug`
+7.  Setting up URL
+8.  Start Debug (Click the green bug button)
+9.  Edit Run Configuration Again
+10.  Mapping Url as below picture
+    * Map your `root` directory with `webpack://.` (please note the last dot)
+    * Map your `build` directory with your root path (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`)
+11.  Hit OK and restart debugging session
+
+![How to debug using WebStorm](webstorm-debug.png)
+
+### Troubleshooting
+
+1. You miss the last `.` (dot) in `webpack://.`
+2. The port debugger is listening tool and the JetBrain extension is mismatch.
+
+### Enable ESLint
+
+ESLint help making all developer follow the same coding format. Please also setting up in your IDE, otherwise, you will fail ESLint test.
+1. Go to WebStorm Preference
+2. Search for `ESLint`
+3. Click `Enable`
+
+![Setting up ESLint](webstorm-eslint.png)
+
+## Use CI with bitbucket pipelines
+
+Your project is on bitbucket? Take advantage of the pipelines feature (Continuous Integration) by creating a 'bitbucket-pipelines.yml' file at the root of the project and use the following code to automatically test your app at each commit:
+
+```YAML
+image: gwhansscheuren/bitbucket-pipelines-node-chrome-firefox
+
+pipelines:
+  default:
+    - step:
+        script:
+          - node --version
+          - npm --version
+          - npm install
+          - npm test
+```
+
+## I'm using Node v0.12 and the server doesn't work?
+
+We settled on supporting the last three major Node.js versions for the boilerplate – at the moment
+of this writing those are v5, v6 and v7. We **highly recommend upgrading to a newer Node.js version**!
+
+If you _have_ to use Node.js 0.12, you can hack around the server not running by using `babel-cli` to
+run the server: `npm install babel-cli`, and then replace all instances of `node server` in the `"scripts"`
+in the `package.json` with `babel server`!
+
+## How to keep my project up-to-date with `react-boilerplate`?
+
+While it's possible to keep your project up-to-date or "in sync" with `react-boilerplate`, it's usually
+very difficult and therefore ***at your own risk*** and not recommend. You should not need to do it either, as
+every version you use will be amazing! There is a long term goal to make this much easier but no ETA at the moment.
+
+## How to turn off Webpack performance warnings after production build?
+
+Webpack recommends having those performance hints turned off in development but to keep them on in production. If you still want to disable them, add the next lines to the config in `webpack.prod.babel.js`:
+  
+```js
+  performance: {
+    hints: false
+  }
+```
+You can find more information about the `performance` option (how to change maximum allowed size of a generated file, how to exclude some files from being checked and so on) in the [Webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/performance/).

+# The Hitchhikers Guide to `react-boilerplate`
+
+The [`README.md`](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate#features) gives you adequate information on how to clone boilerplate files, install dependencies and launch the example app.
+
+Once you have done that, this document is intended to give you a taste of how `react-boilerplate` works. It still assumes basic knowledge of React, Redux and `react-router`. **If you're completely new to React, please refer to https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto instead!**
+
+This is a production-ready boilerplate, and as such optimized for browsers, not for beginners. It includes tools to help you manage performance, asynchrony, styling, everything you need to build a _real_ application. Before you get your hands dirty with the source code, we'd like you to go through a checklist, that will help you determine whether or not you're eligible to use this boilerplate. It's not because we're _holier-than-thou_, but we genuinely want to save you the frustration.
+
+> Opening an issue is the fastest way to draw the attention of the team, but please make it a point to read the [docs](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/tree/master/docs) and [contribution instructions](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you do. The issues section is specifically used for pointing out defects and suggesting enhancements, if you have a question about one of the tools please refer to StackOverflow instead.

+
+## Project Structure
+
+Let's start with understanding why we have chosen our particular structure. It has been an [evolving discussion](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/issues/27), and if you have an afternoon or two we recommend you read the full thread.
+
+If not, here's the TL;DR:
+
+- You will write your app in the `app` folder. This is the folder you will spend most, if not all, of your time in.
+- Configuration, generators and templates are in the `internals` folder.
+- The `server` folder contains development and production server configuration files.
+
+### `app/`
+
+We use the [container/component architecture](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.4rmjqneiw). `containers/` contains React components which are connected to the redux store. `components/` contains dumb React components which depend on containers for data. **Container components care about how things work, while components care about how things look.**
+
+We've found that for many applications treating single pages (e.g. the Loginpage, the Homepage etc.) as containers and their small parts (e.g. the Login form, the Navigation bar) components works well, but there are no rigid rules. **Bend the architecture to the needs of your app, nothing is set in stone!**
+
+### `internals/`
+
+You can call this area the "engine" of your app. Your source code cannot be executed as-is in the web browser. It needs to pass through webpack to get converted into a form that web browsers understand. While it's certainly helpful to understand what is happening here, for real world usage you won't have to mess around with this folder much.
+
+- `internals/webpack`: You'll most probably use EcmaScript 6 or EcmaScript 7 to write the source code of your app. webpack takes care of making it compatible with a majority of browsers.
+
+> ([ECMAScript](http://stackoverflow.com/a/33748400/5241520) is the standard for JavaScript. Most people are still using browsers which understand ECMAScript 5. So your code must be [transpiled](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-transpilers-what-they-are-why-we-need-them) into browser-understandable code. To apply the transpiler to your source code, you will use webpack. Feeling the jitters already? [Don't worry](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.d2uasw2n6). Take a tea-break and then read on)
+
+- `internals/generators`: This folder has the code to scaffold out new components, containers and routes. Read [more about scaffolding](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/tree/master/docs/general#quick-scaffolding) in the docs.
+
+- `internals/mocks`: This folder contains mocks which Jest uses when testing your app, e.g. for images.
+
+The other folders are mostly for the maintainers and/or the setup, and you should absolutely never need to touch them so we are going skip them for the sake of brevity.
+
+### `server/`
+
+As the name suggests, this folder contains development and production server configuration.
+
+## Basic Building Blocks
+
+These days when musicians produce music, they record different parts of the song separately. So vocals, drums, guitar, bass may be played in separate sessions and when they're satisfied with their work, the sessions are combined into a beautiful song. In a similar fashion, let's understand the role of different technologies and in the end, we'll see how everything converges into a single application.
+
+You can launch the example app by running `npm start`. To fully understand its inner workings, you'll have to understand multiple technologies and how they interact. From this point, we're going into an overdrive of implementation details. We'll simplify the technical jargon as much as we can. Please bear with us here.
+
+### How does the application boot up?
+
+Like any other webpage your app starts with the [`app/index.html`](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/blob/master/app/index.html) file. React will render your application into the `div#app` .
+
+But how do we include all of your react components into a single html file? That's where webpack comes into the picture. Webpack will literally pack your application into small javascript files. These files will be injected into the `index.html` as `<script>` tags.
+
+When your application is deployed on a server, browsers will load this html file. The javascript files that webpack has included will be executed by the browser, thereby booting up your react application! It's magic really!! No, not really, though it can certainly seem that way. Let's dissect this phenomenon to better know what's really going on.
+
+### `app/app.js`:
+
+When you run `npm start`, a server will be launched in your terminal for development. You can then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the server and see your app.
+
+Webpack requires an entry point to your application. Think of it as a door to your source code. In this boilerplate [`app/app.js`](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/blob/master/app/app.js) is that entry point. Webpack will access the entire app from this file, transpile the application into ES5 and create small chunks of transpiled code. Only the required chunks will be loaded in the browser so that you don't have to worry about the size of your application.
+
+`app/app.js` is one of the biggest files of the boilerplate. It contains all the global setup to make sure your app runs smoothly. Let's break its contents down:
+
+- `babel-polyfill` is imported. This enables cool stuff like generator functions, `Promise`s, etc.
+- A redux `store` is instantiated.
+- A `history` object is created, which remembers all the browsing history for your app. This is used by the router to know which page your users visit. (very useful for analytics, by the way)
+- A Router is set up, with all of your routes. See [`routes.js`](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/blob/master/app/routes.js)
+- Hot module replacement setup.
+- i18n internationalization support setup.
+- Offline plugin support to make your app [offline-first](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/codelabs/offline/).
+- `ReactDOM.render()` not only renders the [root react component](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/blob/master/app/containers/App/index.js) called `<App />`, of your application, but it renders it with `<Provider />`, `<LanguageProvider />` and `<Router />`.
+ * `<Provider />` connects your app with the redux `store`.
+ * `<LanguageProvider />` provides language translation support to your app.
+ * `<Router />` will have information for your application routes.
+
+### React Router:
+
+`<Router />` sets up your routes. Check out [`routes.js`](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/blob/master/app/routes.js) to see how route `path`s are mapped with application containers.
+
+- Path `"/"` corresponds to container `<HomePage />`
+- Path `"/features"` corresponds to container `<FeaturePage />`
+- Path `"*"` i.e. all other paths correspond to the `<NotFoundPage />` (i.e. the 404 page)
+
+These containers, along with their corresponding reducer and sagas, are loaded asynchronously with the help of dynamic `import()`. Whenever webpack encounters `import()` in the code, it creates a separate file for those imports. That means for every route, there will be a separate file. And by corollary, only those javascript files will be downloaded by the browser which are required for the current route.
+
+**When you navigate to `"/"`, only files related to the Homepage will be downloaded and subsequently executed. This makes your application incredibly lightweight and lightning fast.**
+
+### Redux
+
+Redux is going to play a huge role in your application. If you're new to Redux, we'd strongly suggest you to complete this checklist and then come back:
+
+- [ ] Understand the motivation behind Redux
+- [ ] Understand the three principles of Redux
+- [ ] Implement Redux in a small React app of yours
+
+The Redux `store` is the heart of your application. Check out [`store.js`](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/blob/master/app/store.js) to see how we have configured the store.
+
+The store is created with the `createStore()` factory, which accepts three parameters.
+
+1. **Root reducer:** A master reducer combining all your reducers.
+2. **Initial state:** The initial state of your app as determined by your reducers.
+3. **Middleware/enhancers:** Middlewares are third party libraries which intercept each redux action dispatched to the redux store and then... do stuff. For example, if you install the [`redux-logger`](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger) middleware, it will listen to all the actions being dispatched to the store and print previous and next state in the browser console. It's helpful to track what happens in your app.
+
+In our application we are using two such middleware.
+
+1. **Router middleware:** Keeps your routes in sync with the redux `store`.
+2. **Redux saga:** Is used for managing _side-effects_ such as dispatching actions asynchronously or accessing browser data.
+
+### Reselect
+
+Reselect is a library used for slicing your redux state and providing only the relevant sub-tree to a react component. It has three key features:
+
+1. Computational power
+2. Memoization
+3. Composability
+
+Imagine an application that shows a list of users. Its redux state tree stores an array of usernames with signatures:
+
+`{
+  id: number,
+  username: string,
+  gender: string,
+  age: number
+}`.
+
+Let's see how the three features of reselect help.
+
+- **Computation:** While performing a search operation, reselect will filter the original array and return only matching usernames. Redux state does not have to store a separate array of filtered usernames.
+- **Memoization:** A selector will not compute a new result unless one of its arguments change. That means, if you are repeating the same search once again, reselect will not filter the array over and over. It will just return the previously computed, and subsequently cached, result. Reselect compares the old and the new arguments and then decides whether to compute again or return the cached result.
+- **Composability:** You can combine multiple selectors. For example, one selector can filter usernames according to a search key and another selector can filter the already filtered array according to gender. One more selector can further filter according to age. You combine these selectors by using `createSelector()`
+
+### Redux Saga
+
+If your application is going to interact with some back-end application for data, we recommend using redux saga for side effect management. Too much jargon? Let's simplify.
+
+Imagine that your application is fetching data in json format from a back-end. For every API call, ideally you should define at least three kinds of [action creators](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Actions.html):
+
+1. `API_REQUEST`: Upon dispatching this, your application should show a spinner to let the user know that something's happening.
+2. `API_SUCCESS`: Upon dispatching this, your application should show the data to the user.
+3. `API_FAILURE`: Upon dispatching this, your application should show an error message to the user.
+
+And this is only for **_one_** API call. In a real-world scenario, one page of your application could be making tens of API calls. How do we manage all of them effectively? This essentially boils down to controlling the flow of your application. What if there was a background process that handles multiple actions simultaneously, communicates with redux store and react containers at the same time? This is where redux-saga comes into the picture.
+
+The mental model is that a saga is like a separate thread in your application that's solely responsible for side effects. `redux-saga` is a redux middleware, which means this thread can be started, paused and cancelled from the main application with normal redux actions, it has access to the full redux application state and it can dispatch redux actions as well.
+
+## Example App: Behind the scenes
+
+The react-boilerplate building blocks interoperate to produce a seamless application. Let's join these pieces together.
+
+<img src="workflow.png" alt="boilerplate workflow" align="center" />
+
+### Workflow
+
+The example application is a simple service which shows a list of repositories for GitHub users using GitHub's public API. You type in a username and the application will show you a list of repositories for that user. It also shows how navigating away to a different route can be done. You can switch between English and German by selecting the desired option from the menu in the footer.
+
+#### `<HomePage />`
+
+Run `npm start` to launch the application. If you start browsing at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000), by default you will be navigated to the home page. Here, notice that route is `"/"`, so the [`<HomePage />`](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/blob/master/app/containers/HomePage/index.js) container will be mounted. It is responsible for rendering a form with a textbox and a list of repositories.
+
+- `mapDispatchToProps()`: Generally, we provide outgoing action creators (functions that create [action](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Actions.html) objects) to the react component through this method. Notice that for every keypress in textbox, your state will be updated by dispatching a `changeUsername` action to the store. So at any point in time, your Redux state will hold the currently typed username. When you submit the form, another action, `loadRepos` will be dispatched.
+
+- `mapStateToProps()`: Generally, we provide incoming state from Redux store to the react component through this method. Notice that the we do not provide the entire state to the component, simply because we don't want the react component to have access to irrelevant data. The state will be filtered by selectors such as `selectRepos`, `selectUsername` etc.
+
+Together these two methods work like magic. When you type something in the textbox the following things will happen in a sequential manner:
+
+1. `changeUsername()` will send text to the Redux store. The text can be accessed using `evt.target.value`. Here, `evt` is the `onChange` event emmited by pressing a key.
+2. The Redux store will consult with its corresponding reducer, since a reducer knows what to do with the data.
+3. When a reducer computes a new state tree, the store will update its state with the newly typed data.
+4. An update has occured in the state, therefore `mapStateToProps()` will be triggered and your react component will get the new data.
+5. The updated data will be set as the `value` to your `<Input />`.
+
+_So you see, if you type something in the textbox, it will not be directly reflected in the DOM. It must pass through redux. Redux will update the state and return it to the component. It's the component's responsibility to show the updated data._
+
+#### `HomePage/sagas.js`
+
+You must be wondering where does the list of repositories come from! Sagas are primarily used for making API calls. Sagas intercept actions dispatched to the Redux store. That means a saga will listen to the actions and if it finds an action of interest, it will do something.
+
+Sagas are nothing but ES6 [generator functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*). These functions act as normal functions, the only difference is that they can be "paused" and "resumed" at any point in time. `redux-saga` provides an intuitive, declarative API for managing asynchronous operations.
+
+Check out [`HomePage/sagas.js`](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/blob/master/app/containers/HomePage/sagas.js). It can be confusing for untrained eyes. The API of `redux-saga` is self-descriptive once you've seen it, so let's go over what happens in there:
+
+- You can `fork` a saga to send it to the background. That way, your code will not get blocked even when the saga is continuously running.
+- `takeLatest` is used for listening for a particular action. In this case, it will wait for a `LOAD_REPOS` action. Whenever you disptach this action, the saga will understand that you want to fetch repos from github's public API by calling `getRepos()`.
+- If the API successfully returns some data, a `reposLoaded()` action will be dispatched which carries the data. When redux store receives this action, [a reducer](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/blob/master/app/containers/App/reducer.js) will set incoming data in the new state tree.
+
+_An update has occurred!_ `mapStateToProps()` will be triggered. `<HomePage />` will receive the new data and rerender.
+
+## Why all this fuss just to load a list of repos?
+
+Quite an understandable question!
+
+In the example app, we're basically using a [bazooka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazooka) to kill a fly. The primary purpose of this boilerplate is to provide a robust and scalable infrastructure for large scale projects. Every bit of your project should be predictable. You should have granular control over all the operations. It's overkill for the example app, but not for the real world.
+
+If you want to build a mature application you're going to need a mature infrastructure. That's what this boilerplate provides.

+## Progress Bar
+Route transitions are not smooth over the network because chunks generated by webpack take some time to load. It would cause a poor user experience especially for those with slow internet connections. To tackle this UX issue, `react-boilerplate`'s example app comes with a progress bar which shows _fake_ progress while browser downloads the chunk and renders it.
+
+**How it works**
+
+The ProgressBar percentage depends on the [`listenBefore()`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/docs/API.md#router-1) hook that comes with react-router. A Route change will be caught by React's component life cycle methods.
+
+- Initially, the percentage is `-1`. The progress bar is hidden.
+- Progress is set to `0` when the location changes and it keeps on increasing until the new route is mounted or it reaches `99` _(whichever happens first)_.
+- Percentage is set to `100` when the new route mounts.
+- Percentage is reset to `-1` and ProgressBar is ready for a new route change.
+
+**Default behaviour**
+- `<ProgressBar />` will not show progress for previously loaded routes.
+
+**Limitations**
+- It will not show progress before `main.js` is loaded in the DOM.

+`react-intl` is a library to manage internationalization and pluralization support
+for your react application. This involves multi-language support for both the static text but also things like variable numbers, words or names that change with application state. `react-intl` provides an incredible amount of mature facility to preform these very tasks.
+
+The complete `react-intl` docs can be found here:
+
+https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/wiki
+
+## Usage
+
+Below we see a `messages.js` file for the `Footer` component example. A `messages.js` file should be included in any simple or container component that wants to use internationalization. You can add this support when you scaffold your component using this boilerplates scaffolding `plop` system.
+
+All default English text for the component is contained here (e.g. `This project is licensed under the MIT license.`), and is tagged with an ID (e.g. `boilerplate.components.Footer.license.message`) in addition to it's object definition id (e.g. `licenseMessage`).
+
+This is set in `react-intl`'s `defineMessages` function which is then exported for use in the component. You can read more about `defineMessages` here:
+
+https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/wiki/API#definemessages
+
+```js
+/*
+ * Footer Messages
+ *
+ * This contains all the text for the Footer component.
+ */
+import { defineMessages } from 'react-intl';
+
+export default defineMessages({
+  licenseMessage: {
+    id: 'boilerplate.components.Footer.license.message',
+    defaultMessage: 'This project is licensed under the MIT license.',
+  },
+  authorMessage: {
+    id: 'boilerplate.components.Footer.author.message',
+    defaultMessage: `
+      Made with love by {author}.
+    `,
+  },
+});
+```
+
+Below is the example `Footer` component. Here we see the component including the `messages.js` file, which contains all the default component text, organized with ids (and optionally descriptions). We are also importing the `FormattedMessage` component, which will display a given message from the `messages.js` file in the selected language.
+
+You will also notice a more complex use of `FormattedMessage` for the author message where alternate or variable values (i.e. `author: <A href="https://twitter.com/mxstbr">Max Stoiber</A>,`) are being injected, in this case it's a react component.
+
+```js
+import React from 'react';
+
+import messages from './messages';
+import A from 'components/A';
+import styles from './styles.css';
+import { FormattedMessage } from 'react-intl';
+
+function Footer() {
+  return (
+    <footer className={styles.footer}>
+      <section>
+        <p>
+          <FormattedMessage {...messages.licenseMessage} />
+        </p>
+      </section>
+      <section>
+        <p>
+          <FormattedMessage
+            {...messages.authorMessage}
+            values={{
+              author: <A href="https://twitter.com/mxstbr">Max Stoiber</A>,
+            }}
+          />
+        </p>
+      </section>
+    </footer>
+  );
+}
+
+export default Footer;
+```
+
+## Extracting i18n JSON files
+
+You can extract all i18n language within each component by running the following command:
+
+```
+  npm run extract-intl
+```
+
+This will extract all language into i18n JSON files in `app/translations`.
+
+## Adding A Language
+
+You can add a language by running the generate command:
+
+```
+  npm run generate language
+```
+
+Then enter the two character i18n standard language specifier (e.g. "fr", "de", "es" - without quotes). This will add in the necessary JSON language file and import statements for the language. Note, it is up to you to fill in the translations for the language.
+
+## Removing i18n and react-intl
+
+You can remove `react-intl` modules by first removing the `IntlProvider` object from the `app/app.js` file and by either removing or not selecting the i18n text option during component scaffolding.
+
+The packages associated with `react-intl` are:
+ - react-intl
+ - babel-plugin-react-intl

-## Advanced Usage
-
-ImmutableJS provide many immutable structures like `Map`, `Set` and `List`. But the  downside to using ImmutableJS data structures is that they are not normal JavaScript data structures. 
+## Immutable Records
 
-That means you must use getters to access properties : for instance you'll do `map.get("property")` instead of `map.property`, and `array.get(0)` instead of `array[0]`. It's not natural and your code becoming bigger, you finish by not knowing anymore if you are working with a JavaScript object or an Immutable one. While it's possible to be clear where you are using immutable objects, you still pass them through the system into places where it's not clear. This makes reasoning about functions harder.
+ImmutableJS provides a number of immutable structures such as [`Map`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/Map), [`Set`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/Set) and [`List`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/List).
+One drawback to these structures is that properties must be accessed via the getter methods (`.get` or `.getIn`) and cannot be accessed with dot notation as they would in a plain javascript object.  
+For instance you'll write `map.get('property')` instead of `object.property`, and `list.get(0)` instead of `array[0]`.  
+This can make your code a little harder to follow and requires you to be extra cautious when passing arguments or props to functions or components that try to access values with regular dot notation.  
+ImmutableJS's [`Record`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/Record) structure offers a solution to this issue.
 
-The `Record` structure tries to get rid of this drawback. `Record` is like a `Map` whose shape is fixed : you can't later add a new property after the record is created. The benefit of `Record` is that you can now, along with others .get, .set and .merge methods, use the dot notation to access properties, which is a good point to write simpler code.
+A `Record` is similar to a `Map` but has a fixed shape, meaning it's property keys are predefined and you can't later add a new property after the record is created. Attempting to set new properties will cause an error.  
+One benefit of `Record` is that you can now, along with other immutable read methods (.get, .set, .merge and so on), use the dot notation to access properties.
 
-The creation of a record is less simple. You got to first create the `Record` shape. With the example above, to create your initial state, you'll write :
+The creation of a record is less simple than simply calling `.toJS()`.  
+First, you have to define the `Record` shape. With the example above, to create your initial state, you'll write:
 
 ```JS
-//the shape
+// Defining the shape
 const StateRecord = Record({
-  myData: 'Hello World!',
+  myData: {
+      message: 'Hello World!'
+  }
 });
 
 const initialState = new StateRecord({}); // initialState is now a new StateRecord instance
-                                          // initialized with myData set by default as 'Hello World!'
+                                          // initialized with myData.message set by default as 'Hello World!'
 ```
 
-Now, if you want to access `myData`, you can just write `state.myData` in your reducer code.
+Now, if you want to access `myData`, you can just write `state.myData` in your reducer code and to access the `message` property you can write `state.myData.message` as you would in a plain javascript object.
+
+### Gotchas of Using Records
+
+Although dot notation can now be used to read properties the same does not apply to setting properties. Any attempts to set a property on a `Record` using dot notation will result in errors. 
+Instead setter methods ( `.set`, `.update`, `.merge`) should be used.
+
+Certain properties can not be set on a record as they would conflict with the API. Consider the below example:
+```JS
+const ProductRecord = Record({
+    type: 'tshirt',
+    size: 'small'
+});
+```
 
+Because record.size is used to return the records count (similar to array.length), the above definition would throw an error.

+

+      },
+    },
+  ]
+}
 ```
+
+## Index routes
+
+To add an index route, use the following pattern:
+
+```JS
+{
+  path: '/',
+  name: 'home',
+  getComponent(nextState, cb) {
+    const importModules = Promise.all([
+      import('containers/HomePage')
+    ]);
+
+    const renderRoute = loadModule(cb);
+
+    importModules.then(([component]) => {
+      renderRoute(component);
+    });
+
+    importModules.catch(errorLoading);
+  },
+  indexRoute: {
+    getComponent(partialNextState, cb) {
+      const importModules = Promise.all([
+        import('containers/HomeView')
+      ]);
+
+      const renderRoute = loadModule(cb);
+
+      importModules.then(([component]) => {
+        renderRoute(component);
+      });
+
+      importModules.catch(errorLoading);
+    },
+  },
+}
+```
+
+## Dynamic routes
+
+To go to a dynamic route such as 'post/:slug' eg 'post/cool-new-post', firstly add the route to your `routes.js`, as per documentation:
+
+```JS
+path: '/posts/:slug',
+name: 'post',
+getComponent(nextState, cb) {
+ const importModules = Promise.all([
+   import('containers/Post/reducer'),
+   import('containers/Post/sagas'),
+   import('containers/Post'),
+ ]);
+
+ const renderRoute = loadModule(cb);
+
+ importModules.then(([reducer, sagas, component]) => {
+   injectReducer('post', reducer.default);
+   injectSagas(sagas.default);
+   renderRoute(component);
+ });
+
+ importModules.catch(errorLoading);
+},
+```
+
+###Container:
+
+```JSX
+<Link to={`/posts/${post.slug}`} key={post._id}>
+```
+
+Clickable link with payload (you could use push if needed).
+
+###Action:
+
+```JS
+export function getPost(slug) {
+  return {
+    type: LOAD_POST,
+    slug,
+  };
+}
+
+export function postLoaded(post) {
+  return {
+    type: LOAD_POST_SUCCESS,
+    podcast,
+  };
+}
+```
+
+###Saga:
+
+```JS
+const { slug } = yield take(LOAD_POST);
+yield call(getXhrPodcast, slug);
+
+export function* getXhrPodcast(slug) {
+  const requestURL = `http://your.api.com/api/posts/${slug}`;
+  const post = yield call(request, requestURL);
+  if (!post.err) {
+    yield put(postLoaded(post));
+  } else {
+    yield put(postLoadingError(post.err));
+  }
+}
+```
+
+Wait (`take`) for the LOAD_POST constant, which contains the slug payload from the `getPost()` function in actions.js. 
+
+When the action is fired then dispatch the `getXhrPodcast()` function to get the response from your api. On success dispatch the `postLoaded()` action (`yield put`) which sends back the response and can be added into the reducer state.
+
